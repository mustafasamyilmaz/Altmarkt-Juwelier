Altmarkt-Juwelier-Website
A Freelance Job for a Jewelry Shop that buys and sells precious Metals in various forms. 
The Website will be made purely of HTML and CSS (and Bootstrap + AOS), since it is just a landing page. 
Is not fully finished yet and undeployed, because i need to review it TOGETHER with the client to make sure he is happy with the copywriting, design, layout etc.
